🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to install and run Nexa:

1. Extract the Nexa Vault folder.
Extract or move your Nexa Vault folder from the NEXAPWM.zip file to your Program Files directory:
C:\Program Files\Nexa Vault

2. Create a Desktop Shortcut
Inside the dist folder:
Right-click Nexa.exe
Choose Send to → Desktop (create shortcut)


🗝️ Vault & Master Password Location
After running the program for the first time, Nexa automatically creates its secure storage files in:

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Nexa


Here you’ll find:

Your vault database
Your master password hash

Feel free to explore the files if you’re curious — they are encrypted for your security.

⚙️ Notes
Make sure you have permission to write to the Program Files directory.
Do not delete or move the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Nexa folder; it contains your encrypted credentials.
Keep your master password safe — it’s the only way to access your vault.
